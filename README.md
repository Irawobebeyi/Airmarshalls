AIRLINE FLIGHT DELAYS 

 Project outline:
The project will analyze the flights’ delays, cancellations and other statuses in 
the US for 322 different airlines. The dataset contains just above 5 million 
records with 31 columns. The findings will be presented to a potential airline 
company “Multico Air”, looking at common flight delays in the industry. The 
presentation will target the GM, board of directors and the aviation team.
